# Part-2-Supervised-learning-on-FashionMNIST-dataset-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This Repository involves in using Convolutional Neural Networks too perform multiclass classification on FashionMinst dataset
Three different neural networks are built and comparison has been made to understand the differences.
