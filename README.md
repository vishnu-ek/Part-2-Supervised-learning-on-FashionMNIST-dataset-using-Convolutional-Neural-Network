#### Part-2-Supervised-learning-on-FashionMNIST-dataset-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This Repository involves in using Convolutional Neural Networks too perform multiclass classification on FashionMinst dataset.

Three different neural networks

  1) 2 CNN layers and 2 fully connected layers
  2) 2 CNN layers and 5 fully connected layers
  4) 5 CNN layers and 2 fully connected layers
 
are built and comparison has been made to understand the differences. 

The data can either be obtained from the torchvision dataset module or can be downloaded as a csv file from the following link. https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/data/fashion-mnist/
